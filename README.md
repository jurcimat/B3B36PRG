# B3B36PRG
My codes from course B3B36PRG @CTU Czech Technical University Cybernetics & Robotics

All codes were tested submitted to BRUTE in the summer semester 2019.
I have recieved full marks from homeworks and 19/30+ points from semestral project.
You are free to use any from my code (after end of summer semester 2019) for inspiration but remember that plagiarizm
is punished by CTU and check whether your classmates are using this code for their homeworks/semestral project. 

I wish luck to all future students @KYR/OI. ;)
